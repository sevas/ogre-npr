This work is an attempt to implement different non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) schemes
using the Ogre3D rendering engine (version 1.6.x). Right now, only a first version of line 
strokes rendering (the google sketchup look) is implemented.


Currently, only the Visual Studio 2008 project files are shipped. This may change in the future.
This is work in progress.


THe project files expect the several environnement variables to be set : 
$(BOOST136_HOME) : must point to the installation path of the boost librairy (version 1.36.0)
$(OGRE16_HOME) : must point to the Ogre 1.6 SDK installation path
